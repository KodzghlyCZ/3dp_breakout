# 3D Printer Breakout Board

This project is a 3D printer breakout board designed to separate the printer's mainboard from the printer body, enabling easy body swaps and providing protection for the mainboard when printing in a heated chamber.

## Features

- **Mainboard Protection**: Protects the printer's mainboard from excessive heat in a heated chamber.
- **Body Swap Capability**: Simplifies swapping the printer body while keeping the mainboard intact.
- **Connector Compatibility**: Utilizes the **41612 Connector**, available [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005002338050204.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.16.303c1802Agw1Wc).

## Current Issues

1. **Mirroring Requirement**: To directly interconnect boards, a mirrored version of the breakout board is needed. Without it, a crossover cable is required.
2. **Wire Exposure**: Currently, wires connected to the 41612 connector are exposed. Covers need to be designed to address this.

---

## TODO

- [ ] Design a **mirrored version** of the breakout board to enable direct interconnection.
- [ ] Create protective **connector covers** to shield wires and prevent exposure.

## Usage

1. **Connector Installation**:
   - Solder a **41612 Connector** onto the breakout board.
   - Ensure compatibility with the mainboard and body connections.

2. **Cable Preparation**:
   - Directly solder the wires of the interconnecting cable to the 41612 connector.
   - If a mirrored board is unavailable, use a **crossover cable** for connections.

3. **Assembly**:
   - Mount the breakout board securely in a location away from excessive heat.
   - Attach the connector covers (once designed) to ensure safety and reliability.
